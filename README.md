# Archetype Starter catalog

This is an [Archetect](https://archetect.github.io/) catalog containing
archetypes for starting new archetypes. Yes, there's a bit of Inception going on
here. Instead of creating new archetypes from scratch/by hand, simply use
Archetect itself to generate the scaffolding your new archetype.

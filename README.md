# Archetype Starter catalog

This is an [Archetect](https://archetect.github.io/) catalog containing
archetypes for starting new archetypes.

Yes, there's a bit of Inception going on
here. Instead of creating new archetypes from scratch/by hand, simply use
Archetect itself to generate the scaffolding for your new archetype.

To render an archetype from this catalog, use the following command:

```bash
archetect catalog https://github.com/archetect/archetype-starters.catalog.git
```
